                                        or medium humanoid. If FormLimit tags override the choices to something which is not a humanoid, normally

                                        skips over the normal type check and applies the PolymorphAllow tags for Alter self normally. -->

      and the default behavior when they are added to classes is to have the
      class forward those tags to the hero to grant a class skill. When Mathias
      was working with configurables for UI, he noticed that when added to
      Configurables the same was not happening. This inconsistent behaviour might
      confuse users, so he altered things so no matter where the custom specials
      were added the class skill tags would be forwarded.

      However, several configurables add custom specials not for themselves, but
      for the carryalong info associated with the custom special. For example,
      Eldritch Heritage adds Sorcerer Bloodline Custom Specials so that the
      Class Specials bootstrapped by them can be acted upon, while the Herecite
      race has a configurable which adds Cleric Domains to read the Secondary
      Spells Allowed tags on them for making SLAs of them. Neither actually wants
      any effects from the custom special itself, so this tag is added to prevent
      them from granting class skills when they shouldn't. -->

    <!-- Spell Ability focus
      Spell-like abilities are a valid target for the Ability Focus feat, but
      spells are not always what they seem. Cloned spells fill in for certain
      spells, bootstrapped by feats like Quickened Spell Like Ability. Ability
      Focus normally looks for something with a thingid matching the Target tag
      it is bootstrapped with, which means it fails to find cloned spells. The
      presence of this tag causes it to look for a matching KnownSpell tag
      instead. The existing example of this is Mordiggian, and Quickened Slay
      Living.

    <!-- As of Villain Codex, ARTs need to note their source for display in the
      statblock, but they are not considered important enough for the sourcebook
      they originate from to be displayed in section 1. Therefore, the component
      has this Helper assigned as an autotag. I could have just excluded the
      component as a whole, but this way we can employ the same tag if we further
      expand the list of compsets which should have SourceFull components, or if
      there comes along an ART which is important enough to warrent being shown
      in section 1, it can specifically delete the tag from itself. -->

      The "Rule" on whether unarmed strikes sbNames should show a prepend of an
      enhancement bonus is unclear, as in NPC codex the trend appears to be yes,
      while in later books like the VC it seems not.

      For natural weapons, it appears that in general they should not be shown
      (barring a few counter-examples in Monster Codex, and the Almiraj from
      bestiary 4), so this tag is applied to the component.
