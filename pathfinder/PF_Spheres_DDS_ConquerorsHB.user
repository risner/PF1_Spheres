If there are coins to be paid, they have the time. Mercenaries can be found anywhere there is conflict from adventuring parties looking for a skilled pair of hands, armies looking for extra manpower, and even in the service of evil, should the price pay right.\n\nTODO: Not implemented past 1st level yet. Also need to create Manhunter (Ex) and the bootstrap conditions instead of directly bootstrapping Scout sphere." uniqueness="unique">

He learns two runes from the forgemasterARG cleric's runeforger ability, treating his blacksmith level as his cleric level when determining the effects of runes, and may choose to apply one rune as a maintenance. The duration of a rune applied as a maintenance is the same as a regular maintenance, lasting 24 hours or until their next 8 hour or longer rest, whichever comes first. The blacksmith must still meet any level prerequisites to apply a rune with maintenance. Unlike other maintenance options, runes are supernatural and are suppressed by antimagic fields or other similar effects, and may be removed by an erase spell or other similar effect. Equipment inscribed with runes by the blacksmith bear symbols of the blacksmith's faith or ideology. At 8th level, the blacksmith can apply two runes as part of the same maintenance.\n\nThe blacksmith may take this insight multiple times, each time learning two new runes." summary="Use Profession (blacksmith) in place of Craft and Spellcraft to make or enchant gear">
