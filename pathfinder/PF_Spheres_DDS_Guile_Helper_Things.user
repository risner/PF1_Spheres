  <thing id="trkSoGPlans" name="Plans" compset="Tracker" description="A plan is a contingency set aside when you have a little time to yourself, one that reflects your foresight and cunning. Your plan ability allows you to produce an item or other sorts of practical preparation without having to specify ahead of time how or what you had prepared. Each plan describes what sort of things you can prepare, such as a potion you scrounged up and stashed away after carefully considering what you might have the most trouble facing. Preparing all your plans simultaneously takes 1 hour.\n\nYou can only use these rules to carry out plans specifically allowed by talents or other abilities you possess; however, if your group wants to take a similar approach with other plans in your game when they make sense, see the Dynamic Planning rules.\n\nYou do not describe exactly what you prepared or how until you reveal it; you need not even name a specific [plan] talent. You likewise do not make choices about what you prepared until then. Normally, revealing a plan is a full-round action as part of the action to draw an item from among your equipment, but it can take other forms. For example, a plan talent might say that you can bring along a scroll. You spend 1 hour planning and hunting for just the right scroll in a mage’s guild’s library, but do not have to specify which scroll you planned to bring. When you reveal the plan, you choose which scroll you brought, which you did not have to decide upon until that very moment. You were prepared enough to choose the scroll that turned out to be what you needed.\n\nYou can have a limited number of these plans prepared at one time. Plan uses are not prepared for specific plan talents; instead, you have one or two pools of uses. Having any plan talents gives you a number of {b}uses equal to 1 + the number of plan talents you have without the [utility] tag{/b} that can be used to reveal any plan you know. Your plans remain prepared until you reveal them. You cannot choose something you could not possibly access, but the GM is encouraged to be lenient with what is accessible.\n\nIf any costs are required, they are listed in the plan’s description; some talents allow you to find ways to secure the items without needing to track payments. You must pay any cost required when you reveal the item, effectively revealing that the cost had secretly been paid all along. A plan generally cannot be a specific unique item (like the key to a specific door) except where explicitly allowed.\n\nIf you are (or might be) preparing one or more items, you must choose a weight of planned objects to carry when you prepare your plan. You cannot produce an item weighing more than that amount, and revealing the item subtracts its weight from the weight of planned items you carry. You can unload the planned weight to a beast of burden or store it, but you can only reveal a planned item wherever the weight is stored.\n\nIf your plan strains credulity, the GM might ask you to roll a Knowledge or Sense Motive check to see whether you successfully predicted the circumstances that you find yourself in. A Sense Motive check is appropriate if a creature is responsible for the circumstance. The DC is 15 + 150% the level or challenge rating of the enemy or hazard most directly related to the problem you are solving. If the check fails, you realize you did not prepare what you hoped and you can take a different action instead. Of course, if your plan simply does not make sense, the GM can rule that you cannot even attempt to reveal that plan.\n\nIf you gain a [plan] talent temporarily, you cannot reveal it unless you had the plan talent since you last prepared plans.">

You can spend uses of leverage to use a skill more effectively. You always have a single pool of skill leverage, which you can spend with any skill that you have unlocked skill leverage for. The most common way to unlock skill leverage is from skill spheres.\n\nIf you would unlock skill leverage with a skill you already have it unlocked for, you can unlock skill leverage with another skill of your choice.\n\nIf you have skill leverage, your pool of uses is equal to 1 + one-third your Hit Dice. You regain all uses of your leverage when you get a full 8 hours of rest.\n\nYou can also regain 1 use of skill leverage in any of the following ways:\n\nWhen you thwart a significant encounter with one or more creatures you have not faced before (typically one whose challenge rating is at least your level - 2), generally slaying them, rendering them harmless, or forcing them to abandon a goal for the foreseeable future. You only regain 1 use of leverage for an encounter, even if multiple individuals you defeated would be a significant threat. If an enemy's abilities change or grow, you can gain skill leverage from that foe again.\n\n{indent 50}* When you disable or intentionally avoid a significant trap (again, typically one with a challenge rating greater than your level, equal to your level, or 1 or 2 lower than your level)\n* When you successfully persuade someone to help you who never has before (or trick them into doing so), provided the social encounter was a significant challenge\n* When you make a discovery significant to one of your motivations or that gives you a new path (literal or figurative) to achieving a goal (such as opening a secret door leading somewhere new, learning a secret weakness of a challenging foe, or reaching a significant destination despite there being no known route){indent 0}\n\nIf it is not clear, the GM makes the final decision as to whether you regain your skill leverage. The GM might also allow other methods of regaining skill leverage in circumstances where you can bring a fresh perspective to bear.\n\nSkill leverage can be used in one of the following ways.\n\n{indent 50}* {b}Change Tactics{/b}: After you roll a skill check and see the die, but before the GM says the consequences of the roll, you can spend 1 use of leverage to roll 1d4 and add it to the result.\n\n* {b}Draw on Intuition{/b}: You can spend 1 use of leverage on a skill to get a clue about a creature, obstacle, hazard, or location that skill could be used to identify or interact with. When interacting with a creature, the clue might be something the creature is afraid of, one of its minor motivations, something it wants, or a line of conversation that it is particularly open to or unwilling to entertain. When trying to open a magical vault, the clue might be what the door is made of, the school of magic the vault's magical runes belong to, or where previous users have touched the vault before. This information should generally be of the sort that could be recalled with a Knowledge check with a DC no higher than 15 + twice your ranks in the leveraged skill.\n\n* {b}Seize an Opportunity{/b}: After you roll a skill check and compare the result to the DC, if your total exceeds the DC by enough, you can achieve a better result. If the difference is at least equal to the amount of a penalty or optional DC increase for an improved or greater effect (such as the voluntary penalty to Climb to increase your speed), you can spend 1 use of skill leverage to add the change. You can spend multiple uses of skill leverage to add that many different penalties or DC increases, or apply a stacking penalty repeatedly. If your game uses the Degrees of Success variant (see the Skills chapter), optional penalties and DCs that do not represent significant risk are available at no cost.{indent 0}" uniqueness="unique">
