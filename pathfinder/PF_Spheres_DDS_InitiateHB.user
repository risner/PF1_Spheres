  <thing id="sopDbVulnSpell" name="Vulnerable Spellcaster" compset="SoPDrawbk" description="Your magical capabilities are directly linked to your physical state. When suffering from a condition or effect that bestows an attack penalty (or penalty, ability damage or ability drain to any physical ability score), you apply the largest penalty (counting ability damage or drain as a penalty) to your caster level. These penalties stack if you have multiple conditions, although they may not reduce your caster level below 1. Other penalties to your caster level may reduce your caster level to below 1, in which case any attempt to cast a sphere effect automatically fails, and the spell points are wasted. Additionally, you may not utilize magic while suffering from the frightened or panicked conditions.\n\nIf your caster level is brought below the requirement needed to cast certain advanced magic, rituals, incantations or to qualify for certain feats, you cannot make use of them while your caster level is reduced under the amount needed to cast the sphere effect or qualify for the feat.\n\nNote: Under the GM's discretion, other effects that would penalize the caster in a physical way may apply a similar penalty to their caster level." summary="You must wield a martial/exotic metal weapon to use your magic" uniqueness="unique">
