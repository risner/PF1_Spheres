If you do so, the theory begins with one notion.\n\nYou add the following methods of gaining a notion to your theories:\n\n * You or an ally successfully find a loophole (new skill use) in an effect originating from the subject of your theory, as long as a creature successfully ends the effect on themselves.\n * The subject of your theory uses or is successfully affected by a spell, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has an alignment descriptor or relies on alignment in some way (such as a paladin’s smite evil ability).\n\nYou add the following breakthroughs to your theories:\n\n * {b}Breakthrough{/b}: You can spend any amount of notions as a free action that can be taken outside of your turn to gain an equivalent insight bonus to a single concentration, Spellcraft, or Use Magic Device check, or on a caster level check to overcome a creature’s spell resistance.\n * {b}Breakthrough{/b}: You can spend 4 notions as an immediate action whenever a creature within medium range is killed or banished to its home plane to make it difficult for them to return. In order to return the creature to life or to the plane it was banished from, the caster attempting to return them must succeed on a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your ranks in the Study sphere’s associated skill. You can reveal a plan as part of using this ability to reduce the notion cost of this breakthrough by 2." summary="You gain new notions and breakthroughs for theories..">
