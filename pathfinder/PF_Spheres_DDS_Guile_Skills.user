You must have understood the words of the effect. The check DC equals the effect’s save DC or opposes the skill check result that caused it. Successfully opposing a skill check ends the effect.\n\nIf you succeed and the effect allowed a saving throw, you and each target who can understand your words within 30 feet can attempt a new save immediately. Success on this saving throw grants the usual effect of a success for that effect while failure does nothing. You cannot use Linguistics to find a loophole in that effect for that creature again for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent effect. At the GM’s discretion, the wording of a particular spell or ability might be especially difficult to talk around, increasing the DC by 5.\n\nA character trained in Linguistics can attempt to set a higher DC for finding a loophole in the effect by attempting their own Linguistics check when casting the spell or using the ability; use the Linguistics result instead of the usual DC (this can make the DC lower if they are unskilled or unlucky)." summary="Counter language-dependent spells or effects." uniqueness="unique">

Your estimate has errors beating the DC by 5. The GM secretly rolls 1d3-2 for beating DC by 4 or less. Beating by 5 or more gives you the exact value. An aware opponent can oppose (Bluff or Intimidate) your check without an action.\n\n{b}Impressive Display of Skill{/b}: Use a skill to impress with at least a standard action with a DC high enough to demonstrate your prowess. If both the DC and your result are> 20 + observer’s Hit Dice, and the skill is one that they value, they gain the impressed condition.\n\n{b}Teach (trained only){/b}: You can a trained skill to teach up to 10 other creatures how to perform a task with that skill. You spend at least 1 hour teaching and attempt a DC 15 skill check. Longer time teaming, grants bonuses.\n\n{b}Uses from Other Skills{/b}: Some skills can be used as other skills in certain circumstances.
