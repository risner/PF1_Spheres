# Lend a Hand

## Testing

Try to install, create some characters (many classes are limited in features), report things that are not working correctly to me via Discord above. Keep in mind missing things (talents, classes, sphere packages, feats, etc) are likely just not yet written. Join in and help us out.

## Writing

Enhancing our documentation (Markdown/*.md* files) ensures they are more accessible and easier to follow. If you have ideas for improving clarity or structure, feel free to contribute with a pull request.

## HeroLab Text Input

The Herolab Editor should support adding missing talents (higher priority) and class abilities (for classes missing abilities). Feel free to create *.user* HeroLab editor save files and submit via a pull request.

## HeroLab Editor Enhancing

This requires XML knowledge and understanding of how to script in HeroLab. I have written most, if not all, of this via hand editing XML files. The editor (*PF_Spheres_DDS_Guile_Editor.dat*) may not be up to date nor support all the available tags. I will not have time to address this in the foreseeable future, so please contribute via a pull request any enhancements you make.

## HeroLab Scripting

This requires XML and HeroLab scripting knowledge, but please join in the fun. Contribute some scripts for talents and class features that have missing scripts.
